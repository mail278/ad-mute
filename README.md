# ad-mute
Mute ads of streaming services.

Simple utility that constantly checks if streaming service is playing ad. If so it mutes its output (it DOES NOT skip the ad - you just do not hear it).

For now, only Spotify is supported.


Note: If you like your streaming service consider buying premium/ad-free account.
